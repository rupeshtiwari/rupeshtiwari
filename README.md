I found my team and myself finding difficulties on below things and I build tools/utilities & frameworks to solve them.

- **Messaging Framework**: On Angular project by creating pub/sub library that helps to create loosely coupled modules in Angular.
- **UI Composition problem**: We have many business services while assembling and authoring exams. It is challenging to create website that will have UI components from various services and communicate each other. I leaded the UI composition framework and implemented the solution both in client side (Angular framework) and in Server side ( C# Asp.net ).
- **Migrating AngularJS to Angular**: Came up with strategy and used new Angular features to simplify while brining AngularJS to Angular framework.
- **Migrating old Typescript code to ES6 format**: I had to write my own lil node.js tool to auto migrate lots of old code to ES6 format to migrate large set of code base.
- **Creating VsCode snippets** for helping developers to get boilerplate code.
- **Created JavaScript CLI** for our team to create Angular, NgRX, JS enterprise projects to start.
