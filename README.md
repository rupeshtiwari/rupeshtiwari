## Angular for experts

### NgRX Sample Apps

- [Counter App using NgRX](http://www.rupeshtiwari.com/coding-example-angular-ngrx-counter-app/) : [Source code for ngrx counter app](https://github.com/rupeshtiwari/coding-example-angular-ngrx-counter-app).

### Angular Workspace

Multiple Angular projects can be combined in a single repo. If you have large team and multiple repositories. It will create large churn in the team. Therefore, learn about Angular workspace or monorepo. Here are the resources that will help you to build your monorepo workspace using multiple angular projects.

- [Source Code: Build Angular App using Angular Workspace](https://github.com/rupeshtiwari/coding-examples-angular-workspace-sample) | [Visit demo site](http://www.rupeshtiwari.com/coding-examples-angular-workspace-sample/#/courses)

### Monorepo using NRWL.Nx Framework

Do you want to do micro-frontend and build a Composed UI? Suppose your company has various services, for example, customer and sales service. And you want to make a site with composition UI where both services want to show their widgets. How would you attempt it by not creating a monolith in the client side code base? The answer to this question is MonoRepo with Multi Project architecture. I am using the Nrwl.Nx framework to create my monorepo to achieve UI composition. Also in order to isolate the state of services to corresponding services you could consider using NgRX to manage the state of your application. In your company, are you planning to introduce monorepo? Then consider using [Nx](https://nx.dev) library. I have couple of coding examples for angular and nx monorepo worth checking them out.

- [Article for getting started with Nx Monorepo](https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/getting-started-with-monorepo-with-nx-nrwl/)

**GitHub Source for Nx Monorepo**

- [Angular Monorepo Nrwl.NX sample](https://github.com/rupeshtiwari/coding-examples-angular-monorepo-with-nx)
- [Angular Monorepo Nrwl.NX sample with _advance_ Azure CI/CD](https://github.com/rupeshtiwari/coding-examples-angular-monorepo-nx-azure-ci-cd)

### UI-Composition and Micro-Frontend Example using Angular and NgRx

In general Big ball of mud is not good architecture. Therefore, nowadays microservice architecture is popular. Therefore, in the UI also engineers are trying to apply micro-frontend architecture. I have used angular and ngrx to try to solve UI Composition and created one e-store app to demonstrate the solution. Feel free to check out the source code and live app. I have created composed ui application demonstrating using sales and finance services and creating e-commerce online application to show products, cart and checkout pages. Here is the live [demo for ui composition example/demo app](http://www.rupeshtiwari.com/coding-example-estore-angular-ui-composition/#/products).

- [Source Code for Composed UI demo e-store app](https://github.com/rupeshtiwari/coding-example-estore-angular-ui-composition)

## Angular npm packages that I created

- [Angular Pub/Sub Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fsms/angular-pubsub) to write event driven Angular app.
- [FSMS npm organization](https://www.npmjs.com/org/fsms) to visit more libraries.

- [iOS App iReformat using Xamarin](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ireformat/id969813355)
- [Online e-commerce App MEAN stack](https://online-shop-ecommerce.herokuapp.com/products)

## Challenges I faced and solved

I found my team and myself finding difficulties on below things and I build tools/utilities & frameworks to solve them.

- **Multi-monitor browser communication**: I worked on Fujifilm Medical project to show cardio etc. reports on Web application. That was challenging project I had to solve multi-monitor communication issue using JavaScript.
- **Messaging Framework**: On Angular project by creating pub/sub library that helps to create loosely coupled modules in Angular.
- **UI Composition problem**: We have many business services while assembling and authoring exams. It is challenging to create website that will have UI components from various services and communicate each other. I leaded the UI composition framework and implemented the solution both in client side (Angular framework) and in Server side ( C# Asp.net ).
- **Migrating AngularJS to Angular**: Came up with strategy and used new Angular features to simplify while brining AngularJS to Angular framework.
- **Migrating old Typescript code to ES6 format**: I had to write my own lil node.js tool to auto migrate lots of old code to ES6 format to migrate large set of code base.
- **Creating VsCode snippets** for helping developers to get boilerplate code.
- **Created JavaScript CLI** for our team to create Angular, NgRX, JS enterprise projects to start.

## Mistakes done by Me!

- When I started on my software carrier I was not clear about Separation of Concerns and I used to mix the concerns. Like used to put Repository classes implementations in Domain layer.
